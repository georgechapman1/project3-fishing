# project3-fishing

Story:

As a fisherman, the number one goal is to get to the river.  However, every day the river is different - flow rate, water temperature, clarity, outdoor temperature, time of day, bugs in the air, flies in your flybox, amount of folks on the water, etc.  Also, it is known that being prepared both in terms of gear and expectations for conditions is critical.  Only having a finite window to fish in a given day or weekend means that going into the excursion educated and ready for conditions is the first step to success.  With all these variables, being able to reflect on fishing reports is important. Those are limited and oftentimes not available so you have to rely on your own tact.  The purpose of our app is to give the fisherman an easy to use way to document his experiences and read on other fishermans experiences as it pertains to each river.  The value is the ability to have ready to digest information on past experiences to dial-in on the next excursion.  Everyone casts differently, approaches waterways differently, and chooses flies differently.  So, meet the fishermans best friend: Foam is the Home.

A user can register an account upon opening up the app.  They will provide their email, password, and in-app nickname.  Then they will arrive at homepage (River Journal).  Here there will be a rendering of 5 Colorado Rivers with two links:Write Entry, Journal Entries.

Write Entry - will bring them to the respective river's post blog: Once viewing the river, they can make a blog post in the parameters of date, time window, conditions (water flow, temperature, wind, etc) flies utilized, fish caught, photo upload, and gps location of where they began and an estimate of water covered.  Then, they will submit, bringing them back to the home page.

River Journal - On this page for the respective river, they will have two viewing options: their posts, or their posts and other fishermans blog posts. On their posts, they can view and select edit on any of their previous posts.

As a mobile friendly platform, all anglers will have a valuable resource when approaching their favorite river, or a new river!

Stretch Goal

1) Have GPS populate a pin in the map of where they began their excursion
2) Have fisherman have ability to create a new river
3) Have fisherman be able to comment and ask questions on other fishermans entries
